# Bank System Project
- The bank management system is an application for maintaining a person’s account in a bank. 
- The system provides the access to the customer to create an account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account. 
- Bank Management systems also help bank employees add monthly/yearly interest to an account’s balance or apply service charges for any services provided by the bank. 
- Banks have different account types, where each type has its regulations and charges. Develop an application for a Bank Management System. 
- The user of your system will be able to create different account types for users, view their balance, deposit/withdraw from accounts, apply monthly interests, and deduct service charges.
